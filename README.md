# Nessus Vulnerability Scanning on metasploitable-2

## **Objective**

in this Project we will learn how to setup a Nessus vulnerability scanner in our kali virtual machine, we will be using Nessus essentials, going through the process of getting the license, for free 

using the Nessus to scan a Metasploitable 2 virtual machine and scan it on our bridge network adapter mode  

we have already explained the process of installing the kali on virtual machine and creating a virtual home lab using kali and metasploitable-2

## Tools and resources required

a kali Linux installed on your virtual machine 

a metasploitable-2 virtual machine

Nessus running on your kali virtual machine

## what is Nessus vulnerability scanner?

The Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, developed by Tenable, is a widely-used tool for identifying and assessing vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications. Here are some key points about Nessus:

- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Nessus can perform high-speed asset discovery, configuration auditing, vulnerability scanning, malware detection, and sensitive data discovery1.
- **Accuracy**: It is known for its low false positive rate, making it a reliable choice for security assessments1.
- **Flexibility**: Nessus supports a wide range of scanning policies and can be used to scan various environments, including IT devices, internet-facing assets, cloud infrastructure, and web applications1[2](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/penetration-testing/a-brief-introduction-to-the-nessus-vulnerability-scanner/).
- **Community and Support**: It has a strong community backing and offers various support options, including community support and advanced support packages1.

Nessus is available in different versions, such as Nessus Professional and Nessus Expert, each tailored to different needs and environments1[2](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/resources/penetration-testing/a-brief-introduction-to-the-nessus-vulnerability-scanner/).

## **What is Metasplotable-2?**

**Metasploitable2** is an intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine designed for testing and training in penetration testing and security research1[2](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/). It provides a safe environment to practice exploiting common vulnerabilities without risking harm to real systems1[2](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/).

In the context of **Nessus**, Metasploitable2 serves as an excellent target for vulnerability scanning. Here’s how they relate:

1. **Testing Environment**: Metasploitable2 can be used to simulate a real-world environment with known vulnerabilities. This allows security professionals to test the effectiveness of Nessus in identifying these vulnerabilities12.
2. **Vulnerability Detection**: By running Nessus scans on Metasploitable2, users can see how Nessus detects and reports various vulnerabilities, such as outdated software, misconfigurations, and weak passwords12.
3. **Training and Education**: Using Metasploitable2 with Nessus helps in training individuals on how to use vulnerability scanners effectively and understand the types of vulnerabilities that can exist in a system12.

## **What is Kali Linux?**

**Kali Linux** is a free, open-source operating system designed for advanced penetration testing and security auditing. It is based on Debian and includes hundreds of tools aimed at various information security tasks, such as penetration testing, security research, computer forensics, and reverse engineering12.

Kali Linux is widely used by ethical hackers and security professionals to identify and fix vulnerabilities in systems. It is known for its comprehensive toolset and ease of use, making it a popular choice in the cybersecurity community12.

this command gives us the port on which Nessus is running 

```bash
sudo netstat -nltup
```

Each section of the scan page are different and have its own unique properties 

1. Complete List of Vulnerabilities by Host: This report provides a summary list of vulnerabilities for each host detected in the scan.
2. Detailed Vulnerabilities by Host: This report presents detailed vulnerabilities organized by host.
3. Detailed Vulnerabilities by Plugin: This report presents detailed vulnerabilities organized by plugin.
4. Vulnerability Operations: This report lists host and vulnerability details for each host detected in the scan.

By clicking on "Report," you can generate a report of your choice. There are four options available for you to choose from and multiple file formats.
